      <title>Pension Plan Scale, Bargaining Power, and Investment Allocation and Performance</title>

      <description>This paper uses a unique proprietary database with granular cross-sectional fee and performance data to explore the relation between the structure and size of defined benefit pension plans and their choice of (1) active vs. passive management, (2) internal vs. external management, and (3) allocation to public vs. private markets. Our inquiry is driven by potential scale economies of pension plans related to the market power of large plans, as well as the advantage of human capital directly employed by large plans&amp;mdash;which can potentially provide internal economies in analyzing investments or fund managers.</description>

      <description>Monetary policy is forward-looking, and as part of the FOMC’s effort toward transparency, the FOMC publishes its (forward-looking) economic projections. The overall views on the economy of the FOMC participants–as characterized by the median of their projections for inflation, unemployment, and the Fed’s policy rate–are themselves predictable by information publicly available at the time of the FOMC’s meeting. Their projections also communicate systematic behavior on the part of the FOMC’s participants.</description>

      <title>FOMC Forecasts - Are They Useful for Understanding Monetary Policy?</title>

      <description>Monetary policy is forward looking and, in its pursuit of transparency, it communicates its economic projections to the public at large. As a result, there is interest in whether these projections are credible. We argue that central to that credibility is the public’s ability to replicate the FOMC’s projections using publicly available data only. In other words, is it possible to anticipate, reliably and independently, what the FOMC will anticipate for the federal funds rate?</description>

      <description>This paper uses a unique proprietary database with granular cross-sectional fee and performance data to explore the relation between the structure and size of defined benefit pension plans and their choice of (1) active vs. passive management, (2) internal vs. external management, and (3) allocation to public vs. private markets. Our inquiry is driven by potential scale economies of pension plans related to the market power of large plans, as well as the advantage of human capital directly employed by large plans&amp;mdash;which can potentially provide internal economies in analyzing investments or fund managers.</description>

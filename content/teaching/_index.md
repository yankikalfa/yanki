  description: "Service outside of the classroom is something very important to me. Wherever possible I hope to foster a love of economics in students and see extracurriculuars as a great way to do that. If you are an undergraduate student interested in setting up an Economics Society or similar club at your institution, please reach out to me. I'd be more than happy to talk with you about my own experiences."
